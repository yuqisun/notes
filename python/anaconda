1) You're gonna wanna visit https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyhook download the version with "36" in the name.
2) Open cmd, git cmd, or git bash,
*On cmd change directory into the location where pip and the whl file are stored, type pip install (whl name with 36 in the version name)
*git cmd is the same thing
*On git bash, cd into the directory with the whl and pip and type ./pip install (whl name)
I had the same problem as you, but it turned out the only problem was the file version I was downloading. Make sure you're downloading the version that's compatible with the Python you're using.
